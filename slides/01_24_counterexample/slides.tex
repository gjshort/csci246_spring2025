\item \textbf{Sheet of paper}: Please bring your own sheet of paper to class each day for quizzes if possible. However, if you don't have any, you are welcome to take a blank sheet of paper from the stack in the front of the room.
\item \textbf{Rules for quizzes}: For all quizzes in the course, you should use only paper and pencil.  Please close your computers and textbooks, and put away your cellphones.    
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Friday Quiz}


 \begin{mygreenbox}[title=Reading Quiz (Sec. 6 - Counterexamples)]
Disprove the following conjecture: \\
\vfill 
\textit{Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.  If $a|b$ and $b|a$, then $a=b$.}  \\
\vfill 
Note: You can disprove the conjecture by providing a counterexample.  Make sure to show that your counterexample satisfies the hypothesis (the "if" statement), but not the conclusion (the "then" statement).
\vfill 
\end{mygreenbox}

\vfill \vfill 


 \begin{mygreenbox}[title=Problems Quiz (Sec. 4 - Theorems)]
Two propositions are considered \textit{equivalent} if they have the same truth table values.  Show that the biconditional $A \iff B$ is equivalent to $(A \implies B) \, \texttt{and} \, (B \implies A)$.

\begin{frame}{Observation on Sec. 5 (Proofs) reading quiz}

\begin{myyellowbox}[title=\textbf{Observation}] 
A number of students wrote out expressions that look something like
\[ 2|x + 2|y = 2|z\]
\end{myyellowbox}

\begin{myredbox}[title=\textbf{Warning}] 
This expression has no meaning.    Note from the definition of divisibility (see below) that $2|x$ is itself \textit{already} an equation.  The notation $2|x$  \textit{means} that there is an integer $a$ such that $2a=x$.	
\end{myredbox}


\vfill 
\begin{mydef}[title=Definition (\textbf{Divisible})]
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.  We say that $a$ is \textit{divisible} by $b$ (notated as $b|a$) provided there is an integer $c$ such that $bc=a$.  
\end{mydef}

Great job to 1/3 of the class!
\vfill 
Thoughts if your scores are lower than you want:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strategy} - Read \textit{actively}. Try to work out examples on own while reading
\item \textbf{Time} - Can you increase the time you spend on the reading? 
\item \textbf{Patience and persistence} - You may still be adjusting to mathematical thinking (and/or the quiz formats). Hang in there. Play the long game. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\footnotesize 
	\item Each reading quiz is less than 1\% of your total grade. You just need to catch on eventually. 
	\item The material will be retested (problems quiz and final), and that carries about \textit{twice} as much weight.
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Recruit help} - Get help from me, Fatima (TA), Kelly Joyce (tutor), or elsewhere.

(Optional.) If you have extra time, you might try these for extra practice:
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[a.] Disprove: If $a$,$b$, and $c$ are positive integers with $a|bc$, then $a|b$ or $a|c$.
	\item[b.] Disprove: If $p$ is prime, then $2^p-1$ is also prime.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Group exercise \#1: Solution}

\textbf{Problem.} Disprove: If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $a|b$, then $a \leq b$.
\vfill 

\textbf{Solution (longer).} Let $a=5$ and $b=-5$. We will show that for this choice of $a$ and $b$, the hypothesis holds (i.e. $a|b$), but the conclusion doesn't (i.e. $a>b$).  By definition of divisibility, $a|b$ means that there is an integer $c$ such that $ac =b$. In this case, we need to show that there is an integer $c$ such that  $5c=-5$.  Indeed, the equation holds for $c=-1$.  Therefore, $b|a$, and the hypothesis holds.  However, clearly $a>b$, and so the conclusion fails. 
\vfill 
\textbf{Solution (shorter).} Let $a=5$ and $b=-5$. We will show that the hypothesis holds (i.e. $5|-5$), but the conclusion doesn't (i.e. $5>-5$).  To verify the hypothesis $5|-5$, note that there is an integer $c=-1$ such that  $5c=-5$.  We immediately see that $5>-5$, and so the conclusion fails.
\vfill 
\textbf{Remark.} In here and the following solutions , I provide longer solutions to clarify the logic for students who are struggling. However, in practice, feel free to provide shorter solutions, such as the one above.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Group exercise \#2: Solution}

\textbf{Problem.} Disprove: If $p$ and $q$ are prime, then $p+q$ is composite.
\vfill 

\textbf{Solution (longer).}  Let $p=2$ and $q=3$. We will show that for the counterexample, the hypothesis holds (i.e. $2$ and $3$ are prime), but the conclusion doesn't (i.e. $r=2 \cdot 3 = 5$ is not composite).  By definition of prime, an integer $s$ is prime if $s>1$ and the only positive divisors of $s$ are $1$ and $s$.   When $p=2$, we have that $2>1$ and the only positive divisors are $2$ and $1$, hence it is prime.  A similar statement shows that $q$ and $r$ are prime.  Hence, $p$ and $q$ are prime, and the hypothesis holds.  Moreover, $r$ is prime, and therefore not composite, and so the conclusion fails.   
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Group exercise \#3: Solution}

\textbf{Problem.} An integer $x$ is positive if and only if $x+1$ is positive.
\vfill 

\textbf{Solution (longer).}  Let $A$ be the proposition that an integer $x$ is positive, and $B$ be the proposition that $x+1$ is positive.  We can show that $A \iff B$ fails by showing that $B \implies A$ fails.   We show that there exists a case where $B$ is true, but $A$ is false.  In particular, take $x=0$. Then $B$ is true (since $x+1=1$ is positive), but $A$ fails (since $x=0$ is not positive.)   
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Group exercise \#4: Solution}

\textbf{Problem.} What does it mean for an if-and-only-if statement to be false? What properties should a counterexample for an if-and-only-if statement have?
\vfill 

\textbf{Solution.} Recall from the group exercises of Sec. 4 (Theorems) that $A \iff B$ is identical to $(A \implies B) \, \texttt{and} \, (B \implies A)$.  Hence, we can show that $A \iff B$ fails by showing that either $A \implies B$ fails or $B \implies A$ fails.  (For more information on this strategy, see the group exercise on DeMorgan's law in Sec. 7, Boolean Algebra.)
