Quizzes are in the front of the room, grouped into four bins (A-G, H-L, M-R, S-Z) by last name. The quizzes are upside down with your last name on the back. Come find yours before, during, or after class.  Only turn the quiz over if it's yours.

     \item  Let $A =\set{1,2,3,4}$ and $B=\set{5,6,7}$.  Let $f$ be the relation
	\[  f=\set{(?,?), (2,6),(3,6), (4,7)}\]
	Find replacements for (?,?) so that each of the following is true.
	\begin{itemize} \footnotesize 
		\item [a.] The relation $f$ is not a function from $A$ to $B$.
		\item [b.] The relation $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ but is not onto $B$.
		\item [c.] The relation $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ and is onto $B$.

	\item Fourteen people join hands for  dance.  Suppose seven of these people are men, and the other seven are women.
	\begin{itemize}\footnotesize 
	\item [a.]  In how many different ways can they join hands for a circle dance, assuming they alternate in gender around the circle?
	\item [b.] How many different ways can they join hands for a line dance, assuming they alternate in gender along the line?

	\item Prove Proposition 15.11:  Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on the set $A$ and let $a,x,y \in A$. If $x,y \in [a]$, then $xRy$.
