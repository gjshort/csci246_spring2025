\qOne{What are discrete structures?}
\aOne{A discrete structure refers to a mathematical system that is composed of distinct, separate  elements, as opposed to continuous structures where elements can vary smoothly. Think of a digital clock  vs. an analog clock (where second hand loops around continuously without stopping). Examples of discrete structures include sets with finitely many elements (e.g. the integers 1 to 10), lists, graphs, and logical statements. }


\qTwo{What is discrete mathematics?}
\aTwo{Discrete mathematics is the study of discrete structures and mathematical operations that can be performed upon them.}


\qThree{Why study discrete mathematics?}
\aThree{%It does not directly
%help us write programs. At the same time, 
It is the mathematics underlying almost all of computer science. Here are a few examples: (1)  designing high-speed networks and message routing paths,  (2) finding good algorithms for sorting, (3) performing web searches, (4) analyzing algorithms for correctness and efficiency, (5) formalizing security requirements, and (6) designing cryptographic protocols.
}

\qFour{Where is discrete mathematics used in the MSU computer science curriculum?}
\aFour{Discrete mathematics is used  throughout the curriculum.  Proofs in particular play a critical role in CSCI 338 (Computer Science Theory) and CSCI 432 (Advanced Algorithm Topics).

\section{Course description}

Mathematical concepts used in computer science with an emphasis on mathematical reasoning and proof techniques. This course covers mathematical thinking (elementary logic, theorems, proof techniques), discrete collections (such as sets and lists),  functions and relations,  counting (including permutations and combinations), and miscellaneous topics (recursions, Big-O notation, graphs).  Writing and understanding proofs will be an important part of this course.

\section{Learning Outcomes}

%use \begin{outline} or \begin{outline}[enumerate] to create a list with subitems. 
\begin{itemize}
\item To understand several central concepts from discrete mathematics that are used throughout computer science;
\item To learn to reason mathematically and communicate ideas in a clear and concise manner;
\item To use induction and other techniques of mathematical proofs.
\end{itemize}


%{\color{myCOLOR} Other}\\
%Any required journal articles and book chapters will be provided on \red{Canvas}.

\section{Learning Philosophy}

This course will use an ``inquiry-based learning" approach. This means that classes will not be lecture-oriented. Instead, to quote Dr. Dana Ernst,

\begin{quotation}
\textit{You will be expected to work actively to construct your own understanding of the topics at hand with the readily available help of me and your classmates. Many of the concepts you learn and problems you work on will be new to you and ask you to stretch your thinking. You will experience frustration and failure before you experience understanding. This is part of the normal learning process. If you are doing things well, you should be confused at different points in the semester.}
\end{quotation}

Active learning has been shown to increase student performance in STEM courses (e.g. see \cite{deslauriers2011improved, freeman2014active}). 

%%%%
\vspace{0.2cm}
\section{Class activity}

A typical class meeting will be structured as follows:

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
Mon/Wed
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading quiz: 5 mins.
\item Mini-lecture: 15 mins
\item Group exercises: 30 mins	
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
Fri
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading quiz: 5 mins
\item Problems quiz: 10 mins 
\item Mini-lecture: 5-10 mins
\item Group exercises: 25-30 mins
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

%The course structure follows best practices developed by the Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative (CWSEI).

%%%%%
\vspace{0.1cm} 

{\color{myCOLOR} Group exercises}

The group exercises are for collaborative problem-solving.  Students will be split randomly into groups of three to work on problems using the whiteboards (or windows). Mathematics is not a spectator sport!

%%%%%
{\color{myCOLOR} Daily readings}

Before each class meeting, you will be assigned a reading from the textbook. The reading serves preparation for the group exercises. Before each class, submit your answers to a short reader response questionnaire (with questions like, "what did you find confusing?") posted as a survey Brightspace.  Each class meeting will begin with a 5-minute reading quiz.


%%%%%
{\color{myCOLOR} Weekly review quiz}

The problems quiz will be based on the problems given in-class.

% Lecture is to go over the reading quiz, cover things people didn't understand from the current/previous reading.

\section{Grading}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reading Quizzes (Daily): 25\%  
\item Problems Quizzes (Weekly): 20\% 
\item Project: 15\% 
\item Participation: 15\% 
\item Final: 25\%
\end{itemize}

Grades will be assigned as follows: \\
A: 90-100, B+: 87-90, B: 80-87, C+: 77-80, C: 70-77, D+: 67-70, D: 60-67


%%%%% 
%\vspace{0.5cm}
%\section{Rubric} Quizzes will be graded according to the following rubric.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item (4 points) Correct and well-written.
%\item  (3 points) Good work but some mathematical or writing errors that need addressing.
%\item (2 points) Some good intuition, but there is at least one serious flaw.
%\item (1 point) I don't understand this, but I see that you did work on it.
%\item (0 points) No work is evident.
%\end{itemize}


%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Project} 

The purpose of the project is for students to focus on some aspect of discrete mathematics of particular interest.  Students will work in small groups, choose some aspect of discrete mathematics (that was not covered in class), and develop a 5 minute presentation to give to the class.   For example, a group might give an overview to public key cryptography, or explore how graph theory underlies web search.   More information will be given as the time approaches.


\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Makeup policy}

Quizzes and participation have no makeups. However, I drop 3 reading quizzes, 3 participation days, and 1 problems quiz with no consequence. Missed material beyond that (with a valid explanation) can be replaced with the final exam grade.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Communication expectations}

For non-personal questions related to course content, please use the Ask Your Instructor form on D2L, so that all students can benefit from the question and answer.   For personal questions, please contact me by e-mail.
